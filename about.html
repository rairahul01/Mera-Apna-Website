                  <h3>History</h3>
                  <p> <b>Miss Manju Devi</b> and <b>Mr. Ranjit Rai</b> welcomed a charming and gorgeous baby boy into the world on November 2, 1999,
                    at precisely 5:30 in the morning. I opened my eyes to the outside world in Jagdish Memorial Hospital in <b>Patna</b> 
                    as everyone else in the nation was busy celebrating the birthday of renowned actor Mr. Sharukh Khan.</p>
                  <h3>Schooling</h3>
                  <p> Being born into a Hindu family, I chose the name <b>Rahul Kumar Rai</b> based on a particular horoscope. Later, I was raised in Guwahati, Assam,
                    where my father works in the water unit of the department of public health engineering (PHED).
                   <p>The first day of my exclusive school, "Everest Academy," was on Monday, January 23, 2003, when a four-year-old was dressed like a gentleman.
                     My dad handed me over to my teacher, and even now, seventeen years later, I can still remember the tears that poured down my cheeks, that very day.
                     But very quickly, I became familiar with my school, which not only helped me with all aspects of life and education but also gave me a lot of friends.
                     Gradually, as I continued to study, I discovered that my strongest subject was mathematics.
              Later, I graduated from the school with a grade point average of 83.16. My preference for the "Science" track in my higher secondary education was influenced by my passion
                     in science and mathematics. I was admitted to a college called "Swadeshi Academy" on July 15, 2016. In addition to emphasising the relevance of science in daily life,
                     the institution helped me understand the importance of time in life. Soon after two years had gone, I started taking my final test. 79.9% was the grade I received on the exam. After that, I started to
                     recognise an IITian in myself and made the decision to take a year off to focus on getting ready for the entrance exam (JEE)
                    However, despite my commitment and honesty, I was unable to secure a spot at a reputable IIT institution. Although, I was accepted into the prestigious 
                     <b>Assam Engineering College</b>, where I chose the "Computer Science" department.</p> 
                  <h3>My entry in the field of Web Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have always been quite intrigued about how computers and the internet work.  I was in class IX, w When I first discovered the fundamentals of HTML,
                    Very quickly, I became familiar with HTML and developed a project on it that won me first place at the annual day function. Everything was going well until
                    my Higher Secondary Education course included C++, which made it difficult for me to concentrate on web development. Fortunately, one day I stumbled across UDEMY,
                    an online learning platform. I decided to enrol in a full stack web development course there. In fact, I
                    frequently used a variety of different platforms to broaden my understanding on the subject.
