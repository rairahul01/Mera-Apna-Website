                  <h3>History</h3>
                  <p>Morning at exactly 5:30, on 2nd day of november, 1999, a cute and adorable baby boy was born to <b>Miss Manju Devi</b> and <b>Mr Ranjit Rai</b>. When everyone in the country was busy in celebrating the birthday of famous actor Mr. Sharukh Khan, I opened my eyes to the world in <b>Jagdish Memorial Hospital, Patna</b>.</p>
                  <h3>Schooling</h3>
                  <p>Being born in a hindu Family , I got my name as <b>Rahul Kumar Rai</b>,after preferring from certain Horoscope ..Later on , I was brought up in Guwahati , Assam where my father is employed in thr water unit in Public Health Engineering Department (PHED).
                   <p> On one monday dated 23rd January , 2003 , a four year small child was dressed up like a gentleman ,it was the first day of my esteemed school <b>"Everest Academy"</b>. Since after seventeen years also I can feel th tears that ran through my cheeks my dad handed over me to my teacher.However very soon I got familiar with my school which not only guided me with each and every aspects of life and education but also blessed me with a lot of friends. Gradually with my continue studies, I realised that Mathematics was the subject I scored the best. Later, I passed out from the school with an average marks of 83.16. It was my interest towards Science and Mathematics that allowed me to opt for the stream "Science" in my Higher Secondary Education.It was on 15th of July,2016 when I got admitted to  a college named<b>"Swadeshi Academy"</b>.The college not only taught me the importance of science in our daily life but also  clarified me the value of time in life.Very soon two years passed on and i began sitting for my final examination..The result of the very exam offered me with 79.9 % .. Thereafter  I began to see a IITIAN in myself and decided to drop for an year in order to prepare for the entrance(JEE) ..But my dedication and sincerity towards the entrance was not that enough that could offer me a seat in good IIT college.However I got admission in a very famous college of Assam named "Assam Engineering College ", where I opted the branch "COMPUTER SCIENCE".</p> 
                  <h3>My entry in the field of Web Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    Since my childhood I was very curious about the functioning of Computer and Internet as well. I was in class IX when I first learned the basic concepts of HTML , very soon I got myself familiar with HTML and came up with a project on HTML which awarded me 1st prize on the Annual Day Function.Everything was going well until was assigned with C++ in my syllabus in my Higher Secondary Education as a result I could hardly focus on Web Development. Fortunately one of a sudden day I came accross <b>UDEMY-An online learning Platform.</b> There I choosed for full stack Web Development course. In fact there are many other platforms which I regularly get access to enhance my knowledge in the field of Web Development.
